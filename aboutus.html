            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>ClaySys was founded in 2009 to bring to market high end technical consulting services for Web and Mobile
                development. The model delivers Enterprise Scale Architecture, Design, Development, and Quality
                Assurance Consulting services from its operations center. Our business model is structured to retain top
                talent for the long term, thus ensuring our clients benefit from the tenured technical consultants that
                are part of the ClaySys team. Most of our clients have long-term relationships with us, because of our
                true partnership based engagement model. We also have key relationships with product vendors related to
                specific solution sets, to ensure we can support our clients not only on software development but
                product customization consulting and integration with many key platforms such as Microsoft Azure
                Services, SalesForce, ServiceNow, Sitecore, SharePoint, WordPress, UiPath amongst many others.</p>

            <h2>The Work We Do</h2>
            <p>ClaySys, as a technology consulting service provider, specializes in delivering IT solutions that make a
                positive impact on businesses. Our focus is not only on a successful technical implementation, but we
                are mindful of the business impact all through the project, to ensure we mould and tune the
                implementation to stay aligned with the key business objectives at all times. We work with a wide
                portfolio of technologies and products, to enable us to deliver real value to our customers and to
                provide consulting services to our customers with their existing investments in their technology
                platforms. If you have a defined requirement, our technology consultants would be able to plan, design
                and develop your custom solution, in most cases based on a fixed price engagement. The ability to engage
                on a fixed price basis is dependent on the client's solution requirements being defined in enough
                detail. We also have an option to support a client to initially create and finalize the requirements and
                design, at which point we could transition to a fixed price engagement for the development and final
                deliverable phase.</p>

            <h2>Why We Are Different</h2>
            <p>ClaySys has always focused on a partnership model and building long term relationships with our clients.
                So our focus is always the best interests of our clients, versus just a specific technology project. We
                believe in retaining key employees, as that ensures continuity of quality support to our clients,
                without the disruption associated with a constant churn and attrition with employees. Since we are a
                software product company as well, we try to adhere to the highest standards in terms of technology
                architecture, patterns, security practices, and solution scalability and maintainability.</p>
